- The user interaction part of your program should be well explained or easy to understand.
- Your README should explain the purpose and/or use of the program, and include screenshots of it running.
- Your README should contain full instructions for installing and running the program on a blank MacOS system. Use a guest account on the HackHighSchool check-in computers for testing.
- Your Github repo should specify the license that clarifies what permissions you give for others to modify and reuse your work.
- There should be no unnecessary files in your Github repo that distract from the real content, or any that reveal secrets such as API keys.
- Each file containing code should start with a header block that introduces the origin and purpose of the code.
- Your code should be nicely formatted, and code/function/class/filenames should contribute to its overall readability.
- You should make multiple commits to your Github repository over the course of the project, and your commit messages should be dignified and descriptive.
- You should work socially to some extent by discussing your project with other cadets, whether it be to ask for advice or to show off your work.

### Bonus Part

- Create a new git branch every time you start working on a new feature, and then merge it into the master branch when done.
- Make the program look beautiful with great front-end design or terminal colors and formatting.
- For maximum credit, add 5 additional "features" or improvements on top of the bare mininum functioning program.
- Use the gaming computers at the back of Zone 3 to ensure that your setup instructions also work on a guest account of a Windows operating system.
